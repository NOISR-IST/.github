## Our Mission

To change the origin of digital randomness, by providing random number generators based on real random physical phenomena.

## Why?

Nowadays, most random number generators are, in computational lingo, pseudo-random, this means that, inevitably, there will be patterns that can be detrimental to the application using the RNG.

## Applications

- Cybersecurity - Random Numbers generate keys for authentication protocols and cryptography
- Biology & DNA - Simulating genetic variations and evaluate the probability of mutations and rearrangements
- Medicine - Randomness in virtual trials and molecular simulations
- Optimization - Simulating complex systems like markets, traffic flux or resource allocation
- AI - Generate weights for machine learning algorthims and neural networks
- Games - Virtual environments and simulations that depend on creating random and dynamic responses
- Financial Modeling - Simulation of market dluctuations and risk
- Physics - Generate random fluctuations in initial conditions for physical problems (ex. brownian motion, fluid mechanics...)

And many others...
