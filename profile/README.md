## About

We understand the critical role that random numbers play in various domains, including cryptography, simulations, statistical analysis, and experimental research. We specialize in harnessing genuine physical processes to generate random numbers that exhibit true randomness, ensuring the utmost integrity and reliability for scientific applications.

## Features

- True Physical Randomness: Our random numbers are derived from genuine physical phenomena, ensuring an unbiased and unpredictable nature.
- Diverse Sources: We employ an array techniques to extract randomness from different natural processes, guaranteeing a broad range of generators and  distributions.
- Seamless Integration: Our API provides an easy-to-use interface and supports various programming languages and platforms, making it effortless to integrate into your projects.
- Statistical Analysis: You can access every statistical analysis report to ensure the quality and bias of the random numbers generated. Gain deeper insights into their distribution, properties, and quality to validate their suitability for your specific use cases.
- Biased Random Numbers: Recognizing the power of natural biases, we also offer the option to generate biased random numbers that align with specific natural biases. This approach simplifies and removes the computational need for artificial bias implementation in algorithms, making them more intuitive and efficient.

## Applications

- Cybersecurity: Random Numbers generate keys for authentication protocols and cryptography
- Biology & DNA: Simulating genetic variations and evaluate the probability of mutations and rearrangements
- Medicine: Randomness in virtual trials and molecular simulations
- Optimization: Simulating complex systems like markets, traffic flux or resource allocation
- AI & Machine Learning: Generate weights for machine learning algorthims and neural networks
- Games: Virtual environments and simulations that depend on creating random and dynamic responses
- Financial Modeling: Simulation of market dluctuations and risk
- Physics: Generate random fluctuations in initial conditions for physical problems (ex. brownian motion, fluid mechanics...)
